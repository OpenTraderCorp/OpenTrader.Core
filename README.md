# OpenTrader.Core
This repository hosts the open source core solution of the Open Trader Platform. The `master` branch serves to unify the upstream components on a regular basis. Long-lived release branches host the code that goes into a product version for the lifetime of the product.

The core should be OS agnostic, dependent only on the .Net Standart.
